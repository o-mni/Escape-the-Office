                    <h1>Escape the Office</h1>
                    <p>You jolt awake at a cluttered desk. The fluorescent lights hum overhead while a silent exit door
                        blinks with a locked keypad. The only thing on the desk is a corkboard covered in clues from the
                        old maintenance crew.</p>
                    <p>The crew bragged that the door controls were buried in a directory so boring that only a
                        directory brute-forcer would ever discover it. No direct links. No breadcrumbs. Just a hidden
                        subdirectory that still serves the keypad UI.</p>
                    <p class="muted hint riddle">Riddle: "When the janitors lock a memory, sweep every hallway with
                        GoBuster. Find the chamber where gears are serviced, speak its name aloud and the keypad will answer." </p>
